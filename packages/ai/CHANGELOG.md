# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.18.1] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **Mistral provider**: Added support for Mistral AI models via the OpenAI-compatible API. Includes automatic handling of Mistral-specific requirements (tool call ID format). Set `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable to use.

### Fixed

- Fixed Mistral 400 errors after aborted assistant messages by skipping empty assistant messages (no content, no tool calls) ([#165](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/165))

- Removed synthetic assistant bridge message after tool results for Mistral (no longer required as of Dec 2025) ([#165](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/165))

- Fixed bug where `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable was deleted globally after first OAuth token usage, causing subsequent prompts to fail ([#164](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/164))

## [0.17.0] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- **`agentLoopContinue` function**: Continue an agent loop from existing context without adding a new user message. Validates that the last message is `user` or `toolResult`. Useful for retry after context overflow or resuming from manually-added tool results.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed provider-level tool argument validation. Validation now happens in `agentLoop` via `executeToolCalls`, allowing models to retry on validation errors. For manual tool execution, use `validateToolCall(tools, toolCall)` or `validateToolArguments(tool, toolCall)`.

### Added

- Added `validateToolCall(tools, toolCall)` helper that finds the tool by name and validates arguments.

- **OpenAI compatibility overrides**: Added `compat` field to `Model` for `openai-completions` API, allowing explicit configuration of provider quirks (`supportsStore`, `supportsDeveloperRole`, `supportsReasoningEffort`, `maxTokensField`). Falls back to URL-based detection if not set. Useful for LiteLLM, custom proxies, and other non-standard endpoints. ([#133](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/133), thanks @fink-andreas for the initial idea and PR)

- **xhigh reasoning level**: Added `xhigh` to `ReasoningEffort` type for OpenAI codex-max models. For non-OpenAI providers (Anthropic, Google), `xhigh` is automatically mapped to `high`. ([#143](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/143))

### Changed

- **Updated SDK versions**: OpenAI SDK 5.21.0 → 6.10.0, Anthropic SDK 0.61.0 → 0.71.2, Google GenAI SDK 1.30.0 → 1.31.0

## [0.13.0] - 2025-12-06

### Breaking Changes

- **Added `totalTokens` field to `Usage` type**: All code that constructs `Usage` objects must now include the `totalTokens` field. This field represents the total tokens processed by the LLM (input + output + cache). For OpenAI and Google, this uses native API values (`total_tokens`, `totalTokenCount`). For Anthropic, it's computed as `input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite`.

## [0.12.10] - 2025-12-04

### Added

- Added `gpt-5.1-codex-max` model support

### Fixed

- **OpenAI Token Counting**: Fixed `usage.input` to exclude cached tokens for OpenAI providers. Previously, `input` included cached tokens, causing double-counting when calculating total context size via `input + cacheRead`. Now `input` represents non-cached input tokens across all providers, making `input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite` the correct formula for total context size.

- **Fixed Claude Opus 4.5 cache pricing** (was 3x too expensive)
  - Corrected cache_read: $1.50 → $0.50 per MTok
  - Corrected cache_write: $18.75 → $6.25 per MTok
  - Added manual override in `scripts/generate-models.ts` until upstream fix is merged
  - Submitted PR to models.dev: https://github.com/sst/models.dev/pull/439

## [0.9.4] - 2025-11-26

Initial release with multi-provider LLM support.
