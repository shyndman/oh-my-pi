# Edit (Replace lines)

Line-addressed edits using hash-verified line references. Read file with hashes first, then edit by referencing `LINE:HASH` pairs.

<instruction>
**Workflow:**
1. Read target file (hashes are included automatically in output)
2. Identify lines to change by their `LINE:HASH` prefix
3. Submit edit with `src` (line ref or range) and `dst` (new content)
**Operations:**
- **Replace single**: `src: "5:ab", dst: "new content"` — replaces line 5
- **Replace range**: `src: "5:ab..9:ef", dst: "replacement"` — replaces lines 5-9 with replacement (fewer dst lines = net deletion)
- **Delete range**: `src: "5:ab..9:ef", dst: ""` — deletes lines 5-9
- **Insert after**: `src: "5:ab..", dst: "new line"` — inserts after line 5 (line 5 unchanged)
- **Insert before**: `src: "..5:ab", dst: "new line"` — inserts before line 5 (line 5 unchanged)
**Rules:**
- `src` must be exactly one of: `"LINE:HASH"`, `"LINE:HASH..LINE:HASH"`, `"LINE:HASH.."`, or `"..LINE:HASH"`
- Multiple edits in one call are applied bottom-up (safe for non-overlapping edits)
- Hashes verify file hasn't changed since your last read — stale hashes produce clear errors
- Hashes are derived from both line content and line number (copy them verbatim from read output)
</instruction>

<input>
- `path`: Path to the file to edit
- `edits`: Array of edit operations
	  - `src`: Line reference — `"5:ab"` (single), `"5:ab..9:ef"` (range), `"5:ab.."` (insert after), or `"..5:ab"` (insert before)
  - `dst`: Replacement content (`\n`-separated for multi-line, `""` for delete)
</input>

<output>
Returns success/failure; on failure, error message indicates:
- "Line N has changed since last read" — file was modified, re-read it
- "Line N does not exist" — line number out of range
- Validation errors for malformed line refs
</output>

<critical>
- Always read target file before editing — line hashes come from the read output
- If edit fails with hash mismatch, re-read the file to get fresh hashes
- Never fabricate hashes — always copy from read output
- `src` refs use the format `LINE:HASH` exactly as shown in read output (e.g., `"5:ab"`)
- `dst` contains plain content lines (no hash prefix)
</critical>

<example name="replace single line">
edit {"path":"src/app.py","edits":[{"src":"2:9b","dst":"  print('Hello')"}]}
</example>

<example name="replace range">
edit {"path":"src/app.py","edits":[{"src":"5:ab..8:ef","dst":"  combined = True"}]}
</example>

<example name="delete range">
edit {"path":"src/app.py","edits":[{"src":"5:ab..6:ef","dst":""}]}
</example>

<example name="insert after">
edit {"path":"src/app.py","edits":[{"src":"3:e7..","dst":"  # new comment"}]}
</example>

<example name="insert before">
edit {"path":"src/app.py","edits":[{"src":"..3:e7","dst":"  # new comment"}]}
</example>

<example name="multiple edits">
edit {"path":"src/app.py","edits":[{"src":"10:f1","dst":"  return True"},{"src":"3:c4","dst":"  x = 42"}]}
</example>

<avoid>
- Fabricating or guessing hash values
- Using stale hashes after file has been modified
- Overlapping edits in the same call
</avoid>
